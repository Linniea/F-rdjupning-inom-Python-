This project demonstrates a simple automated ETL pipeline that reads data from a CSV file and transforms the data. 
Inserts/updates the data into a SQLite database, logs all the events and errors to a log file and can be scheduled to run automatically via "cron" on macOS.

It also includes a separate script with automated tests to validate the ETL process.
